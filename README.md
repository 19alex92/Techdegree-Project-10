# Treehouse Techdegree-Project-10
> Todo API with Flask

## Project Description

A fellow student of yours in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree has just taken the Angular Basics course and has a pretty nice working Angular.js Todo app. They went a little farther and used the ng-resource plugin which allows the application to work automatically using RESTful practices. However, they donâ€™t have experience yet on the server side of things. But you do. Can you help them out?
